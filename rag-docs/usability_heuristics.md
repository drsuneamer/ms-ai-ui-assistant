# 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design

## 1. Visibility of System Status
The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.

**Example**: A loading spinner while a page is being fetched.

---

## 2. Match Between System and the Real World
The system should speak the users’ language, with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms.

**Example**: A shopping cart icon instead of "add to list".

---

## 3. User Control and Freedom
Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked “emergency exit” to leave the unwanted state.

**Example**: An undo button in email apps.

---

## 4. Consistency and Standards
Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.

**Example**: Using the same icon for “download” across all screens.

## 5. Error Prevention
Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place.

**Example**: Confirmation step before permanently deleting an item.

## 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
Minimize the user’s memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. Instructions should be visible or easily retrievable.

**Example**: Dropdown menu instead of making user remember all commands.

## 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
Accelerators — unseen by the novice user — may speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both.

**Example**: Keyboard shortcuts in text editors.

---

## 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information competes with relevant units.

**Example**: Clean UI with only essential elements.

---

## 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and suggest a constructive solution.

**Example**: “Your password is too short. It must be at least 8 characters.”

## 10. Help and Documentation
Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation.

**Example**: Searchable FAQ or help center link in app.
